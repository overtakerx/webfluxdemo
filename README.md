# Getting Started
Quick Demo project to show what Spring Boot 2.x WebFlux can do. Using simple example, it can be seen that with 1000 concurrent requests,
the WebFlux performs beyond traditional approach, this project is self contained and can be pulled and run anywhere

Commands:
./gradlew bootRun
./gradlew gatlingRun

This project also includes the wrong way to use WebFlux which pretty much nullifies its advantages


### Reference Documentation
For further reference, please consider the following sections:

For Gatling Output for Normal API invocation VS Wrong Webflux API invocation VS Correct Webflux API invocation please refer to: https://ihendracode.blogspot.com/2019/05/spring-boot-2-spring-webflux-for.html



* [Official Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org)

### Bonus
If you read the code thoroughly, I have also included a quick way to have gatling running side-by-side with SpringBoot
